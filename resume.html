      <p>I want to work for companies that build great products and delivery quality experiences to people. I'm not interested in applications that feel like a burden to use or force them into some sort of cycle, I want to build things that matter to people and people get a genuine enjoyment out of investing their time in. At the same time I want to build applications that help people achieve what they want in life and get out of the way.</p>

      <p>I'm not interested in being a pure backend engineer, my most enjoyable jobs have come when while implementing backend functionality I've worked with designers and frontend developers to produce a good end to end user experience. The backend is responsible for holding up the promise of a good experience: if it's slow, requires too many options or doesn't provide a feedback loop the application breaks down as an experience.</p>

      <p>I'm interested in working with MVC frameworks on the *nix environment. I am a big beliver in the skinny controller pattern, moving common actions out of the controller into a 'manager' which simplifies testing and usage in API endpoints. I prefer to implement the view model pattern (+ serializers) when needed to free up the logic from database models.</p>

      <p>I believe in the web, whether it be as a delivery mechanism for native mobile applications or as applications themselves. With the backend MVC frameworks shomewhat decided, the attention right now is on how frontend applications should be implemented, I'm a big fan of clientside MVC frameworks consuming the application like an ordinairy API.</p>

      <p>I'm always interested in exciting oppurtinities, locally and internationally. If you would like the chat, hit me at <a href="mailto:contact@callumj.com">contact@callumj.com</a></p>
